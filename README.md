# Paintle Front End

Paintle is a fun daily puzzle game inspired by Wordle where players solve a puzzle by painting a 5x5 grid. Each day, a new puzzle is released, and players must fill a 5x5 grid with the correct colors.

The front end of Paintle is developed using Angular as the core framework. See below for instructions on how to run, build, and test the project using the Angular CLI.

## Installing dependancies

To install the required packages, run

```bash
npm install
```

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile the project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```
